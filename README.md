# ethers-simple-storage

A simple and easy-to-use smart contract for storing data on the Ethereum blockchain, written in Solidity.

## Features

- Create, retrieve and delete key-value pairs

## Installation

To use this contract in your project, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) installed. Then, you can install the dependencies by running:

npm install

## Usage

The contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and can be interacted with using the `ethers.js` library. You can find an example of how to use the contract in the repository.


## Deployment

You can deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Truffle. Make sure you have a local development blockchain like ganache running or have access to a testnet or mainnet through a provider like goerli testnet.

## Acknowledgments

* This is a simple and basic smart contract for storage on Ethereum blockchain for educational and small dApp usage and it is not suitable for production use.
* This is not a secure way of storing important and sensitive information.
* This is not a scalable solution for large amount of data storage.
* This contract uses the `ethers.js` library, which is a third-party library and not part of the contract itself.
